// prompts users too hook up apple health to track their bio data
// with an apple watch bpm, sleep analysis, respiratory rate, HRV and more are available
// but most people didnt have apple watches, just phones
// so a lot the data that we will be logging is just steps, kcals, distance, flights climbed ?
// we should still try to get that apple watch data if is there

// this screen will show all their bio data displayed nicely so they can see it 
// behind the scenes the ai in charge of the user data will get access to this when the user does a journal entry for that day
// so basically im going to fetch it, display it (if its available) and store it locally so when they user finishes a journal entry it will be sent to the ai along with the rest of the data in the journal entry 

// build THIS widget tomorrow as well and test it
